# Boyer-Moore_and_Standard-Trie

Implemented the Boyer-Moore string comparison algorithm as well as an algorithm that can 
construct a standard trie.
With two text files. The first, “comparison.txt”, contains two lines. The first line of 
this file contains a long string a text, the second line contains a substring. Found the position 
of the first occurrence of the substring within the main string. The second file, “words.txt”, contains 
a list of words. Construct a standard trie from these words. Assuming these words, 
as well as the substring in the first file, will only consist of the 26 lower case letters of the alphabet.
Implement Boyer-Moore algorithm.
Example output:
Index where substring occurs: 45
(5)
Implemented algorithm to construct standard trie.
As output, performed a depth-first traversal of your trie and output each node’s contents as it 
is encountered.
